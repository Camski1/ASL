Her beef: Corporations could gain the ability to challenge countries\' laws under a complicated provision that\'s routinely tucked into new deals.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe innocuous-sounding \"investor-state dispute settlement mechanism,\" critics on both the left and the populist right fear, would be like an independent, international court, with the power to force the U.S. government and American corporations to abide by its rulings.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue pits Warren against her own party\'s president, and on the same side as populist conservatives. The Massachusetts Democrat took aim at that provision on a conference call hosted by liberal groups on Wednesday, saying it should \"raise alarm bells for everyone.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\"The name may sound a little wonky, but this is a powerful provision that would fundamentally tilt the playing field further in favor of multinational corporations,\" Warren said. \"Worse yet, it would undermine U.S. sovereignty.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLending muscle to Warren\'s opposition is the AFL-CIO, which announced Wednesday that it is freezing contributions to Democratic candidates in order to pump its money into the battle to defeat Obama on trade -- a clear implication that union money will only be flowing to lawmakers who work against their party\'s president on the issue.','http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/11/politics/elizabeth-warren-obama-hillary-clinton-trade/index.html','elizabeth-warren.jpg'),

In their tailored suits, they looked more like businessmen than fighters. They walked through 700 credentialed media members, and into the Nokia Theatre to officially announce their megafight on 2 May in Las Vegas. The fight was officially 52 days away, and for boxing fans five years of seemingly endless waiting was over.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never wanted to win fight so bad in my life, said Mayweather. This is a fight the world can\'t miss. I have a tough task in front of me. It?s always good to see the best fight the best.?\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI like being an underdog, said Pacquiao. It gives me determination. But I am confident 101%.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purse will be upwards of $250m, the richest fight ever. Within seconds of the announcement, the MGM Grand, where the match will be held, was sold out. Tickets are not on sale yet but they will range from $1,500 to $7,500. If some reports are to be believed, ringside seats controlled by the casino could fetch $75,000. They are calling it the biggest boxing match since Ali-Frazier. ?We don?t need to sell this fight, this fight is going to sell itself,? said Mayweather in an interview with some select members of the media before a live-streamed press conference.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFloyd Mayweather Jr vs Manny Pacquiao: kickoff press conference  as it happened\nMayweather and Pacquiao formally announce welterweight title unification bout at Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles\n Read more\nThis fight is very important in boxing history, we don?t want to leave a question mark in the minds of fans,? said Pacquiao.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been a long and strange trip to get to Mayweather vs Pacquiao.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the fighters are older since the dream fight was first discussed five years ago. The American Mayweather (47-0, 26 KOs) is now 38, and the Filipino Pacquiao (57-5-2, 38 KOs) is 36. They are slightly past their peak, but Mayweather is still the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. He might not be able to avoid punches as easily as he once could, and Pacquiao  ranked second on many best pound-for-pound fighter lists  can\'t deliver blows in the cartoonish, rapid-fire combinations of a few years ago, but they are still the most compelling boxers in decades.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOddsmakers are calling Mayweather a 2/1 favorite, but it should be a relatively competitive fight between the greatest defensive fighter in the history of the sport and a relentless  and occassionaly careless  attacker. Pacquiao will have to cut off the ring and time his punches perfectly to have any chance at victory.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFreddie Roach, his trainer, said he has been meticulously studying Mayweather\'s tendencies for five years, I think Floyd had a better chance five years ago. I think his legs are shot. But Manny has to fight the perfect game plan. This is the biggest challenge of my life, but we\'re going to kick [Mayweather?s] ass.','http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/11/floyd-mayweather-jr-and-manny-pacquiao-announce-fight-amid-la-glitz','Mayweather-Pacquiao.jpg'),

It was wrong and reckless.\nMeanwhile, the parents of another student seen on the video, Levi Pettit, released a statement that said he made a horrible mistake, and will live with the consequences forever.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe apologies came after the University of Oklahoma president, David Boren, expelled the two students who appeared to be leading the chant. He did not release their names. Boren said others involved would face discipline.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chant referenced lynching and indicated black students would never be admitted to the university\'s chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.\nRice said in his statement that he withdrew from the university on Monday. The statement from Pettit\'s parents did not address his status with the university.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Pettit and Rice are from Texas.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRice said threatening calls to his family had prompted them to leave their north Dallas home.

Gilbow said she was singing along to a song.

Now gun-friendly state lawmakers are looking to change that.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen legislators enacted a law to allow guns in parks in 2009, they allowed communities to opt out if they wished. More than 70 did. As a result, Republican state Rep. Mike Harrison said, Tennessee\'s nearly 500,000 permit holders are confused about which parks are off-limits.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHarrison is sponsoring a bill to allow permit holders to be armed in parks and playgrounds across the state, and the House Civil Justice Committee advanced the measure by voice vote on Wednesday.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\"We\'ve had seven years of people with gun carry permits all across the state ? in state parks, local parks, Little League games ? and there\'s not been any problems,\" he said. \"So this would just make it consistent across the state.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen Chandler Wright, a member of the Tennessee chapter of the Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said the measure raises serious concerns for parents.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\"It\'s going to be allowing people to carry guns into playgrounds and places where we take our children,\" she said. \"It doesn\'t seem right to have them come in and override the community\'s decision on whether to allow the guns.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRepublican Gov. Bill Haslam opposed similar legislation in the past, and as mayor of Knoxville, supported a 2009 City Council vote that kept in place a ban on handguns in some of the city\'s parks.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe told reporters earlier this month that he has discussed the measure with the mayors of the state\'s four biggest cities, who, he said, made the argument that \"we bought and paid for these parks and we should be able to decide what happens in them.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Haslam said he would be willing to consider a compromise on the measure if one could be worked out.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guns-in-parks bill is one of dozens of firearm bills introduced this year that include measures to do away with permit requirements, prohibit employers from disciplining workers who store guns in cars parked at work and make the semiautomatic .50-caliber Barrett rifle the state\'s official firearm.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSupporters of loosening handgun carry laws in Tennessee have long argued that permit holders\' background checks and training ensure that they are responsible enough to be armed in most public situations.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChandler said she is dismayed by the annual barrage of legislation seeking to make firearms more prevalent in the state.\n\n\"We don\'t need any of these extreme gun bills,\" she said. \"They would turn our city and our state into the Wild West.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Associated Press','http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/3/11/tennessee-mulls-removing-control-over-guns-in-parks.html','gun.jpg'),

A first offense would carry a $100 fine.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe House has passed several decriminalization bills in past years, but they have failed to make it out of the Senate. Governor Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, has said she would veto a decriminalization bill.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWednesday\'s winning margin in the Republican-majority House, however, was bigger than in previous votes in favor of decriminalization, and it raises the possibility that a super-majority of lawmakers may be able override any veto by the governor.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA growing number of U.S. states have relaxed marijuana laws, including Washington and Colorado where voters have approved the legal sale of the drug. Possession of small amounts of marijuana became legal in Washington, D.C., last month though Republicans in the U.S. Congress blocked any measures to allow its sale, noting that it remains illegal under federal law.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSupporters of the bills have argued that current criminal penalties for marijuana possession are particularly out of place in New Hampshire, whose state motto is \"Live free or die.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sponsor of the decriminalization bill, Representative Adam Schroadter, a Republican from Newmarket, pointed to a recent poll that showed nearly 60 percent of New Hampshire residents support the legalization of marijuana.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\"New Hampshire is a grassroots state,\" he said in an interview before the vote. \"People here are very politically aware.

Knowles referred to Jackson as an \"honorable man\" and thanked him for his service.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nProtesters had called for Jackson\'s removal since the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white Ferguson police officer on Aug. 9. The killing triggered protests in cities around the country and drew national scrutiny to police use of deadly force, especially against black men.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither a grand jury proceeding nor the federal probe led to any charges against Darren Wilson, the officer who killed 18-year-old Brown.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it was the Justice Department findings that the police department was routinely targeting African-Americans for arrests and ticketing, largely to raise revenue for the city, that led to what the city called a \"mutual decision\" for Jackson to resign. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nJackson\'s departure follows those of Ferguson City Manager John Shaw and Municipal Judge Ronald Brockmeyer earlier this week. Three other employees of the police department and municipal court left their jobs last week following the release of the Justice Department report. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nAsked by a reporter at the press conference whether he would be the next to go, Knowles responded, \"Somebody is going to have to be here to run the ship.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCommunity leaders praised the police chief\'s resignation. \"Chief Jackson stepping down is long overdue,\" said Patricia Bynes, a local Democratic leader. \"It should not have gotten to this point. All the things that the Justice Department found that happened under his watch, you really have to question what made him think he could still be chief of police.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn its report on Ferguson, the Justice Department said it found evidence that the mostly white police force in the mostly black community was more focused on revenue raising than public safety. The Justice Department also said officers had a pattern of using excessive force and making illegal arrests, as well as deploying attack dogs and using Tasers on unarmed people. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nJackson has commanded the police department since he was appointed by the city manager in 2010. The department has a total of 54 sworn officers divided among several divisions.\n\nJackson\'s departure is effective March 19, and he leaves with a severance payment and health insurance for one year, the mayor said.\n\nThe city said it would conduct a nationwide search for Jackson\'s replacement. But Attorney General Eric Holder said last week that the Justice Department could decide to possibly dismantle the Ferguson Police Department.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMayor Knowles said Wednesday the town did not plan to take that step, though some local activists believe that still needs to happen.\n\n\"This is a big step to continue to move forward but ... isn\'t enough,\" said Rasheen Aldridge, a member of a commission formed by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to recommend community reforms. \"The systemic problems that have been going on in Ferguson need to be dealt with.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThomas Harvey, a St. Louis civil rights attorney who has been critical of the actions of the police in Ferguson and other St. Louis-area cities, said the abuses are common throughout the region. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n\"It is very dangerous to mistake what should have already happened six months ago as progress,? Harvey said.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFerguson knew this was happening and waited for the DOJ to force its hand. Nothing changes for the region unless every town subjects itself to its own DOJ investigation.?\n\nAl Jazeera and Reuters','http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/3/11/ferguson-police-chief-resigns-after-scathing-federal-report.html','Ferguson.jpg'),

Star Trek: The Animated Series is debated and the expansive library of Star Trek novels and comics, although still part of the franchise, are generally considered non-canon.[Note 2]\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first series, now referred to as \"The Original Series\", debuted in 1966 and ran for three seasons on NBC. It followed the interstellar adventures of James T. Kirk and the crew of the starship Enterprise, an exploration vessel of a 23rd-century interstellar \"United Federation of Planets\". In creating the first \"Star Trek\", Roddenberry was inspired by Westerns such as Wagon Train, along with the Horatio Hornblower novels and Gulliver\'s Travels. In fact, the original show was almost entitled, \'Wagon Train to the Stars.\' These adventures continued in the short-lived Star Trek: The Animated Series and six feature films. Four spin-off television series were eventually produced: Star Trek: The Next Generation, followed the crew of a new starship Enterprise set a century after the original series; Star Trek: \n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager, set contemporaneously with The Next Generation; and Star Trek: Enterprise, set before the original series, in the early days of human interstellar travel. Four additional The Next Generation feature films were produced. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a relaunch with a prequel to the original series set in an alternate timeline titled simply Star Trek. This film featured a new cast portraying younger versions of the crew from the original Enterprise.[Note 3] A sequel to this film, Star Trek Into Darkness, premiered on May 16, 2013. A thirteenth theatrical feature, the next sequel to Into Darkness, has been confirmed for release in July 2016, to coincide with the franchise\'s 50th anniversary.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStar Trek has been a cult phenomenon for decades.[1] Fans of the franchise are called Trekkies or Trekkers. The franchise spans a wide range of spin-offs including games, figurines, novels, toys, and comics. Star Trek had a themed attraction in Las Vegas that opened in 1998 and closed in September 2008. At least two museum exhibits of props travel the world. The series has its own full-fledged constructed language, Klingon. Several parodies have been made of Star Trek. Its fans, despite the end of Star Trek episodes on TV, have produced several fan productions to fill that void.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStar Trek is noted for its influence on the world outside of science fiction. It has been cited as an inspiration for several technological inventions such as the cell phone. Moreover, the show is noted for its progressive for its era civil rights stances. The original series included one of television\'s first multiracial casts. Star Trek references can be found throughout popular culture from movies such as the submarine thriller Crimson Tide to the cartoon series South Park.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek','320px-STIn_Beauty.jpg'),

The Obama administration decided to issue the executive order because it found there wasn\'t sufficient progress in talks between South American foreign ministers and the Venezuelan government, who met over the weekend to discuss the strife between the Venezuelan government and its opposition.The unrest in Venezuela began to escalate in February 2014, with nationwide protests calling for freedom of speech, better security and an end to goods shortages. The crisis continues over a year later.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring this period, tensions with the United States have also flared. President Nicolas Maduro announced on Feb. 28 that Venezuela will require visas from Americans intending to travel to the South American country, perhaps precipitating the White House decision.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaduro also announced in the same speech last week that his government had captured an American pilot \"of Latino origin with all kinds of documentation, and he\'s making statements.\"\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn comments Monday, though, Obama administration officials focused on their allegations of abuses and corruption.\n\n\"Venezuelan officials past and present who violate the human rights of Venezuelan citizens and engage in acts of public corruption will not be welcome here, and we now have the tools to block their assets and their use of U.S. financial systems,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement Monday.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe added, \"We have consistently called on the Venezuelan government to release those it has unjustly jailed as well as to improve the climate of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as the freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly.\"\n\nThe Venezuela Embassy declined to comment on the sanctions, deferring to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The ministry did not immediately offer a response to the White House announcement.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Diosdado Cabello, president of the Venezuelan National Assembly and a government loyalist, had strong words for the United States following Obama\'s action.\n\n\"Does Venezuela represent a threat to the United States?
